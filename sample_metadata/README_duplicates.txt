The situation with duplicates needs to be dealt with. 

There are two types. Those between runs 20 and 36 are easy, just remove Run20 plate 1 from the data. 

For the others, I think we also have to remov. We believe that these duplicates are the result of typos at some point (field / wet lab / seq submission). If so then which one is the typo will not be known. Also the typo could be at one of several places in the sample name, meaning maybe the source and recipient lake are correct, but maybe not. Thus without some guess work we probably can't know for sure where these samples really come from, or went to. 

Given that this is about 45 out of 9000 samples, I think we can get away with excluding them. 

So all I need to do is remove these, and the Run20 plate 1 paths to create the final sample set.

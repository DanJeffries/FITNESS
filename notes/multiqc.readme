## MultiQC --------------------------

I ran multiqc (v1.8) per run for all the fastqc outputs distributed with the raw data. 

Manually checking the outputs showed no concerning patterns. The samples that failed the 
GC or sequence quality checks were always those with extremely low yeild (due to low input DNA).

I will retain all samples at this stage. I will trim in the next step and then align. Only after alignment 
will I remove samples which are not worth continuing with.
